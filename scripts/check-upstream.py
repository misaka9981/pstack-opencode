"""Upstream drift check for the pstack opencode port.

Fetches upstream pstack/ (from git's cursor/plugins monorepo or a local
checkout), applies the port's mechanical convention mapping
(Cursor -> ZCode -> opencode, deterministic substitutions only), diffs the
mapped copy against this repo's skills/ and agents/, and reports what
upstream changed that we have not absorbed.

Files that carry one-off SEMANTIC port edits (transcript rewrites, agent
frontmatter, model wording) cannot be reproduced by the mapping; they are
listed in SEMANTIC below and flagged [SEMANTIC] in the report so a human
re-applies those edits when upstream touches them.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-upstream.py                    # default: github.com/cursor/plugins
    python3 scripts/check-upstream.py /path/to/pstack-monorepo
    python3 scripts/check-upstream.py /path/to/pstack --out /tmp/report

Exit status: 0 on a completed check (even when drift is found),
2 on operational failure (bad source, clone failure, timeout).
