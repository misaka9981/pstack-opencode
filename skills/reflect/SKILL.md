# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent finds its own session before fanning out. Sessions live in SQLite at `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (WAL mode, so query with `sqlite3` in read-only mode or copy the file first if the DB is live). Do not read other projects' sessions. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

```bash
# <workspace-path> is spliced into the SQL: double any single quotes in it
# (e.g. /a/'b' becomes /a/''b''), same escaping the audit scripts use.
sqlite3 "file:$HOME/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db?mode=ro" \
  "SELECT id, title, datetime(time_created/1000, 'unixepoch')
   FROM (SELECT id, title, time_created, time_updated FROM session
         WHERE directory = '<workspace-path>'
         UNION ALL
         SELECT id, title, time_created, time_updated FROM session_v2
         WHERE directory = '<workspace-path>')
   ORDER BY time_updated DESC LIMIT 10"
```

Two session generations: V1 (`session` + `message` + `part`; order messages and parts by `time_created`) and V2 (`session_v2` + `session_message`; order by `seq`). V1 text content lives in `part.data.text`; V2 embeds the whole message, content parts included, in `session_message.data`. Timestamps are ms epoch integers.

For each candidate, check that its first user message contains the conversation's opening user prompt. Take the matching session id. If no session resolves, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `task` calls, one per reviewer. Distinct types are preferable (configure via `~/.config/opencode/pstack-roles.md`), but the defaults may share a type. Reviewers need MCP access for context lookups (tickets, chat threads, observability traces referenced in the transcript), so use types with full tool access. The prompt forbids file writes; the parent applies edits.

| Lens | `subagent_type` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | your configured reflect-judgment type (default `general`) | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | your configured reflect-tooling type (default `code-reviewer`) | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | your configured reflect-judgment type (default `general`) | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the session id or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the `task` response body.

### 3. Synthesize

One `task` call, `subagent_type: general` (or your configured reflect-judgment type). The synthesizer's quality check includes spot-verifying citations, which can require MCP access, so keep full tool access. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the `skill-creator` skill (from the `skill-creator` plugin) and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `skill-creator` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via skill-creator: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `skill-creator`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
